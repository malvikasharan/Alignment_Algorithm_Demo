**Introduction & Background**

*Sequence Alignment*

- Sequence alignment algorithms are ways to **arrange two or many biological sequences** 
- They **identify regions of similarity** that may indicate to functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

*Sequence Alignment Algorithm*

> A variety of computational algorithms have been applied to the sequence alignment problem. These include slow but formally correct methods like dynamic programming. These also include efficient, heuristic algorithms or probabilistic methods designed for large-scale database search, that do not guarantee to find best matches.
